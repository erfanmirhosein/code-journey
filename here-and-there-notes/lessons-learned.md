# Lessons I Learned Throuought my Career

# The First 2 Years

* Listen to conference leclectures, They'll give you good insights and open so many doors to you that you never knew existed
* Think "through" your decisions, they may sound good in the begining, but as you go further down the road, you'll face problems that'll show how bad the decision actually was. always think
about the ways things could go wrong and think about different scenarios in which a piece of code will operate and see if it can fulfill the requirements. what happens if you want to change something, undo an operation, etc.
* Don't mingle with seniors, keep it about work. Don't argue with them when you're palnning something, the dynamic will change, you'll get emotional therefore you will not be able to focus and possibly say something that will lead to them to not respect your professional oppinion any more. think about what they've told you after the meeting and analyse whether they were right or wrong.
* always do your tasks in the order you were told to, don't attempt doing things just because you think is right unless the time spent will not be substantial and you're certain that it will bring some value to the project.
* if a bug happens or a tool is giving out errors, don't blindly test stuff out, read through the logs and see what's wrong. if you don't know anything about the problem, spend time to learn the basics so your debugging will be more efficient.
* Don't express your knowledge unless you are explicitely told to, there is a good chance that you will be wrong and people stop respecting your opinions. in most cases people don't even care about the problem and you'll just waste your time.
* in relation to your colleagues, always adjust your behavior. you can not treat all the people the same. some people are better to be just colleagues, you will not lose anything by keeping it professional with them. some people think that if you're friendly, they can disrespect you or say something careless that could change the dynamics of your work place.
* Don't be a technology buff. focus on basics first in early days of your career. try to gain insights instead of just adding to the list of technologies you have worked with. Effective Java and Designing Data Intensive applications are some examples of books that can help you understand WHYs instead of HOWs.
* If in your work place you dont' get the chance to explore new things, do it in your free time. if lack of time made you do something quickly, get back to those topics and learn them properly.
